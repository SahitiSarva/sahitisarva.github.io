# Time Spent and Lessons Learnt from my time at the Development Data Partnership

In this analysis, I reflected on the time I spent at the Development Data Partnership, quantified the lessons I learnt from it, and visualized it. 

I noticed that divide my time differently based on the priorities of the team. However, the values I personally derive from it can be different from the time I spend on it. To understand the initiatives that have taught me a lot, I first listed the tasks I typically spend my time on, and assigned a value for how much learning I get from it. 

## Data

The data for this study is an approximate guesstimate of my time working with the team. The data was prepared by identifying four primary buckets of tasks I undertook - Data Partnership Operations, Partnership Portal IT Coordination, Creation and Maintenance of Data Goods and Heatwave Data Collaborative.

Each task is divided into multiple subtasks. Each was assigned a value for time and lessons learned. The time and value assignment were all given on a scale of 1 to 5.
