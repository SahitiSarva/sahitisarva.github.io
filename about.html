        I’m Sahiti. Of the many permutations of my name, my favorite is Sahityam (<a class="telugu">సాహిత్యం</a>). 
        I only recently entered the world of public policy where I try to channel my mild frustrations from walking ill-lit streets, searching for data in developing countries and navigating patriarchal institutions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I usually spend my time writing, coding and, playing storytelling games. But I’m most proud of holding 8-hour long conversations, moving apartments on a bicycle, wearing a saree in five different styles and a handful of amazing friends.
        <br>
        <br>        
       Currently, I’m looking to tell more stories about gender, culture and society in developing countries. I also want to document and translate oral stories from Indian regional languages*. If you have a story your grandmother handed to you, a secret stash of data waiting to be visualized or an idea that will let us to build a whole new urban mythology, I can’t wait to hear from you.

        *I speak Telugu and Hindi and understand some Tamil. We could document/translate stories from any of them. <br>
        <!-- <sup>+</sup>I usually write visual essays with <b><a href = "https://www.leonardonicoletti.com/" target = "_blank" class="link">Leonardo</a></b> and tell stories with <b><a href = "https://www.policymythology.com/" target = "_blank" class="link">Connor</a></b>. They're both great to work with as well! -->
